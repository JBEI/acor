#ACOR

This is a direct port of a C++ routine by
[Jonathan Goodman](http://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/goodman/index.html) (NYU) called
[ACOR](http://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/goodman/software/acor/index.html) that
estimates the autocorrelation time of time series data very quickly.

[Dan Foreman-Mackey](http://danfm.ca) (NYU) made a few surface changes to the
interface in order to write a Python wrapper.
