#ACOR

This is a direct port of a C++ routine by Jonathan Goodman (NYU) called
[ACOR](http://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/goodman/software/acor/index.html) that
estimates the autocorrelation time of time series data very quickly.

Dan Foreman-Mackey (NYU) made a few surface changes to the interface in order to
write a Python wrapper.
